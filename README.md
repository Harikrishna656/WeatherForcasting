Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology
to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and
time. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the
atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology of project how
the atmosphere will change at a given place. By monitoring the
atmospheric conditions such as temperature Pressure humidity, wind
speed and wind direction, Sunshine, cloud formations, rainfall (or
snowfall), etc. It is possible to predict the coming weather in advance.
Prediction of weather in advance is called weather forecasting.

Usage
Weather Forecasting is crucial since it helps to determine future
climate changes With the use of latitude, we can determine the
probability of snow and hail reaching the surface.
The following things can be the answer why we need it
+ To plan a journey
+ To plan meeting/commute timings
+ To know weathers the day is rainy or not
+ To receive alerts/warning in advance
+ To decide what to wear
+ Some travellers may need to know more about visibility, chances of
rain fall.
+ Seas on sand nature play a major role in agriculture and farming when
it comes to the farming of various fruits vegetables, and pulses,
temperature is extremely important

Random Forest Algorithm

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that
belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both
Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept
of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple
classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance
of the model.
As the name suggests, "Random Forest is a classifier that contains
a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and
takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset."
Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the
prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of
predictions, and it predicts the final output.
The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy
and prevents the problem of overfitting.
 

Random Forest works in two-phase first is to create the random
forest by combining N decision tree, and second is to make predictions
for each tree created in the first phase.
The Working process can be explained in the below steps and
diagram:

Step-1: Select random K data points from the training set.
Step-2: Build the decision trees associated with the selected data
points (Subsets).
Step-3: Choose the number N for decision trees that you want to
build.
Step-4: Repeat Step 1 & 2.
Step-5: For new data points, find the predictions of each decision
tree, and assign the new data points to the category that wins the
majority votes.
Publish the weather
The final step in the process is publishing the Weather using
Random Forest Algorithm and Weather attributes (temperature, wind
direction, visibility, humidity and pressure)
